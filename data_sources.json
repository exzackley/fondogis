By incorporating SRTM data, conservation managers can model species ranges, identify areas at risk from climate change impacts, and optimize patrol routes for effective enforcement. The accessibility assessments derived from this dataset can inform the placement of infrastructure such as ranger stations and visitor centers.\n\nFurthermore, the consistent and readily available nature of the SRTM DEM makes it an invaluable tool for creating baseline data across Mexico's diverse ANPs.
